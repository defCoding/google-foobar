# Problems like these tend to have some sort of pattern to them - either by comparing
# the answers directly to the input or by looking at the pattern of answers. 
# So I started looking at the answers for various input, starting from 1. While I
# couldn't find a pattern between the input and the expected output, I
# did notice a pattern in the "generous" and "stingy" solutions separately.

# The "stingy" solution was simply the Fibonacci sequence. This made sense, as the 
# stingy approach would be to pay each henchmen a value equal to the sum of its
# two immediate subordinates.

# The "generous" approach is simply the powers of 2. Once again, this makes sense, as
# the generous approach is to give each henchmen as much as possible, which would be
# the double the immediate subordinate.

# Looking at the sum of powers of 2, we see a pattern 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127...
# The pattern is simply a power of 2 - 1. So for a given n, we just need to find
# the closest power of 2 - 1 that is less than or equal to n and get the total amount
# of people paid. To do that, we simply need to do floor(log(n)) (base 2).
# However, constraint 4 does throw a twist into this. If the remaining amount of
# lambs after using the above sequence is greater than or equal to the sum of the
# last two powers of 2 used in the sequence, then we will need to use that up to pay
# a henchman. So we need that condition as well.

# For the Fibonnaci sequence, the sum of the first n fibonnaci numbers is equal to 
# the (n + 2)th fibonnaci number - 1. So I just need to find the closest fibonnaci
# number that is less than or equal to the solution + 1, and subtract 2 from its position
# in the sequence to get the total amount of henchmen paid in the stingy solution.
